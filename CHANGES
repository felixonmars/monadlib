Version 3.0
  * Add instane from `MonadFail`---none of the transformers implement this
    functionality so the implementation just lifts things.

Version 3.8
  * Added `WithBase`

Version 3.3.0

* Remove 'RunStateM'
  Simplifies the library without loosing functionality.
  It seems that we can get the same behavior by just using 'get' and 'set'.

* Add functions that use a monad morphism to "derive" implementations
  of most of the funcitons in the library.
